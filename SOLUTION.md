## Overview

Git Differ is a full-stack application that interacts with the GitHub API to display file differences in a user-friendly UI, similar to GitHub. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, while the frontend is developed with React and Chakra UI. This document outlines the architectural decisions, known limitations, and potential future improvements for the project.

### Technology Choices

- **Node.js and Express**: Chosen for the backend due to their efficiency in handling asynchronous operations and the ease of creating RESTful APIs.
- **TypeScript**: Used for both backend and frontend to ensure type safety and improve code quality.
- **React**: Selected for the frontend for its component-based architecture and extensive ecosystem.
- **Chakra UI**: Utilized for a consistent and responsive UI with minimal effort.
- **Axios**: Employed for making HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
- **Vite**: Chosen for its fast build and development environment for the frontend.

### Key Features

- **File Difference Display**: The core feature of the application, allowing users to visualize file changes from GitHub repositories.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across different devices.

## Known Limitations

1. **Componentization**: 
   - **Current State**: The frontend is not fully componentized, leading to potential issues with code maintainability and reusability.
   - **Trade-off**: Prioritized the core functionality over componentization to meet the project deadline.
   - **Future Improvement**: Refactor the frontend to break down the UI into smaller, reusable components.

2. **API Call Caching**:
   - **Current State**: API calls are not cached, which can lead to increased load times and unnecessary API requests.
   - **Trade-off**: Focused on implementing the core functionality first. Caching was considered an optimization to be handled later.
   - **Future Improvement**: Implement caching mechanisms using libraries like `react-query` or custom caching solutions to optimize performance.

3. **React Router Usage**:
   - **Current State**: React Router is not fully utilized, limiting the application's navigational capabilities.
   - **Trade-off**: Basic routing was implemented to ensure core functionality, with advanced routing left for future development.
   - **Future Improvement**: Enhance the routing structure to support nested routes and dynamic loading of components.

4. **Backend Organization**:
   - **Current State**: The backend code is not well-organized, leading to potential difficulties in maintenance and scalability.
   - **Trade-off**: Focused on delivering a working solution quickly. Organization and structuring were deferred.
   - **Future Improvement**: Refactor the backend to follow best practices for project structure, such as separating routes, controllers, and services.

5. **GitHub Authentication**:
   - **Current State**: GitHub authentication is not implemented, limiting the application's ability to perform authenticated API requests.
   - **Trade-off**: Chose to implement basic API functionality first. Authentication was considered a secondary feature.
   - **Future Improvement**: Integrate GitHub OAuth to enable authenticated requests, providing access to a wider range of GitHub API features.

6. **Code Optimization**:
   - **Current State**: The code can be further optimized for performance and readability.
   - **Trade-off**: Prioritized functionality over optimization due to time constraints.
   - **Future Improvement**: Perform a thorough code review to identify and implement performance optimizations and refactor for better readability.

## Missing Features and Future Enhancements

   - **What**: Refactor the frontend to create reusable and maintainable components.
   - **How**: Break down existing UI elements into smaller components.
   - **Why**: To improve code maintainability and reusability.

2. **API Call Caching**:
   - **What**: Implement caching mechanisms for API calls.
   - **How**: Use libraries like `react-query` or custom solutions.
   - **Why**: To reduce load times and optimize API usage.

3. **Advanced Routing**:
   - **What**: Fully utilize React Router for better navigation.
   - **How**: Implement nested routes and dynamic loading.
   - **Why**: To improve the user experience with smoother navigation.

4. **Backend Refactoring**:
   - **What**: Organize the backend code following best practices.
   - **How**: Separate routes, controllers, and services.
   - **Why**: To enhance maintainability and scalability.

5. **GitHub Authentication**:
   - **What**: Integrate GitHub OAuth for authenticated requests.
   - **How**: Use GitHub OAuth to get user tokens.
   - **Why**: To access more GitHub API features and provide a personalized experience.

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **What**: Optimize the code for better performance.
   - **How**: Identify bottlenecks and refactor code.
   - **Why**: To improve the overall efficiency and responsiveness of the application.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the core functionality of displaying file differences using the GitHub API. While there are known limitations and areas for improvement, the current implementation provides a solid foundation. Future enhancements will focus on improving code quality, performance, and adding more features to deliver a more robust and user-friendly application.
